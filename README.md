# degen-nft

Degen NFT is a technical soulbound token represented as an NFT, which is an internal Access Pass To V2 Credit Accounts. 

Its purpose is to give access to Leverage Ninjas to deploy strategies and use leverage across DeFi while Gearbox V2 is in beta mode. One NFT usually means 1 Credit Account pass, with the debt asst choice as per the NFTâ€™s owner. Keep in mind that if you close an account after opening, the access pass is effectively "burned". 

You can request to get on the list if you ready to trade & farm with big size, see all the details on [forum](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-21-leverage-ninja-mode-limits-for-v2/1572).
